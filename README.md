# Google-Maps-Automation

Google Maps is a powerful tool for business research, lead generation, and 
competitor analysis.However, manually extracting business information is
time-consuming. This project aimed to automate data extraction from Google
Maps based on specific business niches and locations, storing the retrieved data
in an organized format for future use.

#Objectives

• Automate the process of searching for businesses on Google Maps.

• Extract key business details such as name, address, contact information,
website links, and ratings.

• Store the collected data in an Excel or CSV file for further analysis.

• Reduce manual effort and time consumption in data collection.

#Tools & Technologies Used

• Python – Used for writing automation scripts.

• Selenium WebDriver – For browser automation and interaction with
Google Maps.

• BeautifulSoup – For parsing HTML and extracting business information

• Pandas – For data processing and structuring into Excel sheets.

• Excel/CSV – For storing extracted data in a structured format.

#Implementation Process
1. Defining Inputs: The script takes user inputs for business niches (e.g.,
"restaurants") and locations (e.g., "New York").
2. Automating Search: Using Selenium, the script opens Google Maps,
enters the search term, and fetches search results.
3. Extracting Business Data: The script navigates through listings,
extracting details such as business name, contact number, website, and
ratings.
4. Storing Data: The extracted data is structured and saved in an Excel file,
making it easy to filter and analyze.
5. Completion & Exporting: Once all results are collected, the data is
exported into a well-structured report for further use
